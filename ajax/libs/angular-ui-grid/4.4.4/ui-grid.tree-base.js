   *
   * <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><strong>Beta</strong> This feature is ready for testing, but it either hasn't seen a lot of use or has some known bugs.</div>
   *
   * This module provides base tree handling functions that are shared by other features, notably grouping
   * and treeView.  It provides a tree view of the data, with nodes in that
   * tree and leaves.
   *
   * Design information:
   * -------------------
   *
   * The raw data that is provided must come with a $$treeLevel on any non-leaf node.  Grouping will create
   * these on all the group header rows, treeView will expect these to be set in the raw data by the user.
   * TreeBase will run a rowsProcessor that:
   *  - builds `treeBase.tree` out of the provided rows
   *  - permits a recursive sort of the tree
   *  - maintains the expand/collapse state of each node
   *  - provides the expand/collapse all button and the expand/collapse buttons
   *  - maintains the count of children for each node
   *
   * Each row is updated with a link to the tree node that represents it.  Refer {@link ui.grid.treeBase.grid:treeBase.tree tree documentation}
   * for information.
   *
   *  TreeBase adds information to the rows
   *  - treeLevel: if present and > -1 tells us the level (level 0 is the top level)
   *  - treeNode: pointer to the node in the grid.treeBase.tree that refers
   *    to this row, allowing us to manipulate the state
   *
   * Since the logic is baked into the rowsProcessors, it should get triggered whenever
   * row order or filtering or anything like that is changed.  We recall the expanded state
   * across invocations of the rowsProcessors by the reference to the treeNode on the individual
   * rows.  We rebuild the tree itself quite frequently, when we do this we use the saved treeNodes to
   * get the state, but we overwrite the other data in that treeNode.
   *
   * By default rows are collapsed, which means all data rows have their visible property
   * set to false, and only level 0 group rows are set to visible.
   *
   * We rely on the rowsProcessors to do the actual expanding and collapsing, so we set the flags we want into
   * grid.treeBase.tree, then call refresh.  This is because we can't easily change the visible
   * row cache without calling the processors, and once we've built the logic into the rowProcessors we may as
   * well use it all the time.
   *
   * Tree base provides sorting (on non-grouped columns).
   *
   * Sorting works in two passes.  The standard sorting is performed for any columns that are important to building
   * the tree (for example, any grouped columns).  Then after the tree is built, a recursive tree sort is performed
   * for the remaining sort columns (including the original sort) - these columns are sorted within each tree level
   * (so all the level 1 nodes are sorted, then all the level 2 nodes within each level 1 node etc).
   *
   * To achieve this we make use of the `ignoreSort` property on the sort configuration.  The parent feature (treeView or grouping)
   * must provide a rowsProcessor that runs with very low priority (typically in the 60-65 range), and that sets
   * the `ignoreSort`on any sort that it wants to run on the tree.  TreeBase will clear the ignoreSort on all sorts - so it
   * will turn on any sorts that haven't run.  It will then call a recursive sort on the tree.
   *
   * Tree base provides treeAggregation.  It checks the treeAggregation configuration on each column, and aggregates based on
   * the logic provided as it builds the tree. Footer aggregation from the uiGrid core should not be used with treeBase aggregation,
   * since it operates on all visible rows, as opposed to to leaf nodes only. Setting `showColumnFooter: true` will show the
   * treeAggregations in the column footer.  Aggregation information will be collected in the format:
   *
   * ```
   *   {
   *     type: 'count',
   *     value: 4,
   *     label: 'count: ',
   *     rendered: 'count: 4'
   *   }
   * ```
   *
   * A callback is provided to format the value once it is finalised (aka a valueFilter).
   *
